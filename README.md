# Video Manager
## About The Project
This is the project based on my last coursework, An application that can manage all the videos, list videos and play it
## Reason for this 
I just think it is fun to make and maybe can help me organize my video when I need it. That's it!!!
## How to run the project
To run this project, clone/download the repo and run:

<b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b>

This will install all the required packages
## Some errors you may meet while using the app
This application is not fully finished yet, because I'm too lazy to cover all the errors, especially when you just use functions but do not choose any videos or lists :))
## Update In the future
I'm gonna fix all the errors when I have time.
I will try to find a way to update the player.
## Contributed
If you have any idea or additional function you want me to implement into the project, please contact me!!!
